# Simple Calculator in Python using Tkinter

This project is a basic calculator built using Python's `Tkinter` library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The calculator supports basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- Simple GUI interface for easy use.
- Performs basic arithmetic operations: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- A clear button (`C`) to reset the input field.
- An equals button (`=`) to evaluate the entered expression.
- Input is entered via on-screen buttons.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- You must have Python installed (version 3.x).
- Tkinter is usually included with most Python installations. If for some reason you don't have it, you can install it via:

```bash
pip install tk
